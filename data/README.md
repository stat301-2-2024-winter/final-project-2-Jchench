## Dataset

The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) that I'm using is from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. This dataset uses information from higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees. ^[Realinho,Valentim, Vieira Martins,Mónica, Machado,Jorge, and Baptista,Luís.

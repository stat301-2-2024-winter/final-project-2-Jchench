## Basic repo setup for final project

My final product will look at data on college drop out numbers to try to predict the factors that make a student more prone to dropping out.

## Folders:

-   `data`: folder with original data and cleaned data. See more in the readme in the folder.
-   `memos`: includes the r scripts, qmds, and html files for my progress memos. See more in readme in the folder.
-   `results`: contains all results. See more in readme in the folder.
-   `R Script`: contains all R scripts. See more in readme in the folder.

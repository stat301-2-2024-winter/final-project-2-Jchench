## Basic repo setup for final project

My final product will look at data on college drop out to try to predict the factors that make a student more prone to dropping out.

## Folders:

- `data`: folder with original data and cleaned data. See more in the readme in the folder.
- `memos`: includes the r scripts, qmds, and html files for my progress memos
